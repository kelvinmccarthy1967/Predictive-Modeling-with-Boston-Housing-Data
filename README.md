# üè° Boston Housing Predictive Modeling  

## üìå Overview  
This project explores the **Boston Housing dataset** to analyze the factors that influence housing prices and to build predictive models. Both **regression** and **classification** approaches were applied, enabling comparison across different machine learning techniques.  

The project demonstrates **statistical analysis, model selection, and predictive modeling** skills essential for real-world data science applications.

## üîç Key Steps  
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
  - Summary statistics, missing value checks, and outlier detection  
  - Correlation analysis and visualizations (heatmaps, scatterplots)  

- **Regression Modeling**  
  - Linear Regression with `crim ~ tax`  
  - Stepwise selection using **AIC**  
  - Ridge & Lasso regression for regularization  
  - Confidence and prediction intervals  

- **Classification Modeling**  
  - GLM (logistic regression)  
  - Decision Tree classifier for predicting `crimbin`  

- **Advanced Models**  
  - Poisson regression (GLM) for `rad`  
  - Random Forest for regression  

- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Metrics: **MAE, RMSE, R¬≤, Accuracy, AUC**  
  - Cross-validation for robustness

## üìä Results  
- **Regression:** Ridge & Lasso improved generalization compared to OLS.  
- **Classification:** Random Forest outperformed GLM and Decision Tree in predicting categorical outcomes.  
- **Feature Insights:** Tax rates, pupil-teacher ratio, and accessibility to highways were strong predictors.
